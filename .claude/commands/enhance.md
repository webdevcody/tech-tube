Suggest improvements to the following component or page by referencing the existing design documentation and structure. Consider best practices in UX, UI consistency, and accessibility (a11y). For each suggestion, explain how it aligns with the current design system (see docs/design.md) and how it enhances usability, accessibility, or visual coherence. Where possible, provide concrete recommendations or code snippets for:

- Improving layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- Enhancing color contrast and readability
- Ensuring keyboard and screen reader accessibility
- Aligning with the established component patterns and theming
- Supporting responsive and mobile-friendly design

Reference specific sections or patterns from the design docs to justify your suggestions. Apply these changes for me.
